# 🧩 Etch-a-Sketch

A browser-based Etch-a-Sketch built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can choose a grid size and draw by hovering over squares. Each square gets a random color on first hover and darkens by 10% with each pass.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic grid generation (up to 100×100)
- Hover to draw
- Random RGB color on first interaction
- Progressive darkening on repeated hovers
- Button to reset and resize grid

## 🧱 Built With

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript

## 📦 How It Works

1. Click the button to choose a grid size.
2. Enter the number of squares per side (e.g., “50” for a 50×50 grid).
3. Hover over the grid to draw.
4. Click the button again to reset or change the size.

Event delegation is used so the grid only needs one event listener for coloring.
